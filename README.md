# Earthquake

Hunter and Mahad

Our sphere is a mesh object that we decided to use for both Earth and Earthquake visualizations. Its made of triangle-strips. 
Our strategy for displaying earthquakes makes use of scaling and color to depict magnitude. In src, we have a texture gradient from yellow to red, and the u texture coordinate shifts based on the magnitude of the earthquake.

We've added the earthquake colors texture and a sun texture to the data folder, so those would be necessary to run the code.

One (sort-of) wizardly thing we've done is to add a sun to the side.
