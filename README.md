# Earthquake

Hunter and Mahad

Our sphere is a mesh object that we decided to use for both Earth and Earthquake visualizations. Its made of triangle-strips. 
Our strategy for displaying earthquakes makes use of scaling and color to depict magnitude. In src, we have a texture gradient from yellow to red, and the u texture coordinate shifts based on the magnitude of the earthquake.
